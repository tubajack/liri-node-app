# liri-node-app

Node.JS assignment for the Coding Bootcamp at UT Austin. 

The LIRI bot is similar to the Iphone's SIRI. 
The biggest difference is that SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface. 
LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface.

## Creating the Application
When I first saw the specifications of how to complete this project, I thought that this is definitely going to be challenging. 
Making matters even more challenging was the fact that my instructor decided to push the due date up a week. 

After getting some good examples in class, and getting good advice from my instructor, I decided to start tackling the project. 
Before starting, I planned out the project using a project board. This board enabled me to split the project into smaller, more manageable tasks. 

**First Issue**: The first issue that I ran into on this project was making sure that I got all of the right files downloaded into the program. 

*Resolved*: I read through the directions for this several times before downloading everything that I needed. 

**Second Issue**: I needed several APIs to make this project work. I was able to get all of the APIs that I needed except for the BandsinTown API. 
I had to email the customer support department there to get the API that I needed. 
They don't just give anyone the API. They asked me for verification and for my instructor's verification. 

*Resolved*: It took me a day to realize that there was an API for Bands in Town already provided. My instructor pointed that out to me **after** I got my own
API from BandsinTown.  


## Functions in the liri.js Application
Since I will not be able to deploy this site to github pages, it is important that I have a good readMe page in order to ensure that this project works. 
There are four functions: BandsInTown, Spotify, MovieAPI, and Do What it Says. Each of these functions will be discussed in further detail. 

### Bands in Town

### Spotify

### MovieAPI

### Do What it Says
