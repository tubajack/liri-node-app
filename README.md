## Creating the Application
When I first saw the specifications of how to complete this project, I thought that this is definitely going to be challenging. 
Making matters even more challenging was the fact that my instructor decided to push the due date up a week. 

After getting some good examples in class, and getting good advice from my instructor, I decided to start tackling the project. 
Before starting, I planned out the project using a project board. This board enabled me to split the project into smaller, more manageable tasks.
